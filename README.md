# zoo_animal_life_expectancy
With an interest in combining my animal science background with data science, I used this data to visualize the differences in the median life expectancy amongst a variety of animals commonly found in zoos.  These visualizations prove to be especially useful in seeing the differences in the median life expectancy and whether the animal is data deficient.  Being categorized as a data deficient animal by the International Union for Conservation of Nature means that there is not enough information collected to form a proper assessment of conservation status.

This data was sourced from data.world.  They were able to source the data from the article “Sex-specific median life expectancies from ex situ populations for 330 animal species” by Judy P. Che-Castaldo, Amy Byrne, Kaitlyn Perisin, and Lisa J. Faust.  Many of the visualizations created were created by starting in a python notebook.  From here I was able to group and experiment with the variables to incorporate into the streamlit application.

To further improve this app, I would love to eventually include a page on the geographical locations of various zoos in the United States.  To my knowledge and searching abilities this data does not currently exist.  To also further improve the usefulness of this app, including data on the median life expectancy in the wild is also something I wish to add in the future.
